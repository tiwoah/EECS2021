; GOAL: Write an assembly program that
; first asks the user to enter an unsigned integer
; and then carries out consecutive divisions by 2 in a loop
; to find all the digits in the binary representation of the entered unsigned number.
; Since the binary digits will be obtained in reverse order,
; push each binary digit in the stack when found.
; Finally organize a loop to pop from the stack and print the digits one by one
; on the same line thus showing all the digits of the binary number in proper order.
